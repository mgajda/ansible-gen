pip package requirments:

- pyxml
- boto 

Stage1:
-------
Currently I am using static inventory script to reach to hosts using ip,
1. Use ansible_execute.sh script to execute playbook
2. Need to change ip in hosts file in repo directory
3. Need to replace ssh keys name and it-self key in ansible_execute.sh script
4. Execute ansible_execute.sh 

Stage2:
-------
Using dynamic inventory, added ec2.py and ec2.ini in repo
1. Make sure following has been added to ~/.ansible.cfg
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
2. Put aws access/secret key in ~/.aws/credential
3. change config and key name and path in ec2_config.yml
4. Use ansible_execute_aws.sh to execute playbook
It will create instance (based on config saved in ec2_config.yml) and execute ansible.yml script (generated by ansible-gen.py) on created instance

Save config:
We can use aws cli or python boto to save config of existing instance in ec2_config.yml
