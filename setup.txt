pip package requirments:

- pyxml
- boto 

Stage1:
-------
Execution
- Use ansible_execute.sh script to execute playbook
- Currently I am using static inventory script to reach to hosts using ip,
- Need to change ip in hosts file in repo directory
- Need to replace ssh keys name and it-self key in ansible_execute.sh script
- Execute ansible_execute.sh 

Stage2:
-------
For stage 2:
I will use dynamic inventory.
I have added ec2.py and ec2.ini in repo
I have check above ansible script with dynamic ansible inventory(it is working), just configuring, using tag(Name=client1) (No need of ip)
Later on we will also provision instance with ec2.py

Save config:
we can use ./ec2.py --list (or ./ec2.py --host blahblah) to save config of existing hosts, and later on can use that config for instance provisioning, along with software config.
